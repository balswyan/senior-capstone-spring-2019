Looking at User Trends Through Their Web Browsing History

Project by: Bandr AlSwyan and Ravi Sajjan

Abstract:

The purpose of this capstone project is to give academic researchers and marketing firms the information and tools to perform analysis on user web browsing trends with possibility of drawing conclusion about political polarization. The need for this application is greater than ever. As people in the modern era produce more and more data, the demand for a tool to help us understand this data and it affects our lives is needed. Our tool will help lower the barrier to entry of understanding of the data provided. It does this by giving the user easy to understand visualizations. The data that will be integrated into the application will be provided by Professor Ericka Menchen-Trevino and was collected from people with their consent and approval through [Web Historian](http://www.webhistorian.org/). The application front end will consist of an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website, and the data will be represented through R as a backend, a data processing software tool. The purpose of this report is to show the breakdown of what was required to complete the project. There are a number of costs that comes with the features of the project. Some of these costs are due to the large amount of data, it is required to have ample data storage and processing power so that the handling can be smooth. This application is developed with mindset that the user will use it to draw conclusions on things such as human interaction and trends, and explore more information about their dataset.
